Project Highlights:
Person Class Implementation: Developed a Java class to model a person, encapsulating attributes such as name, age, and gender.
Encapsulation and Data Protection: Demonstrated the use of encapsulation to protect the integrity of the data within the class.

Key Features:
Constructors: Provided multiple constructors for flexible object initialization with various attribute sets.
Getters and Setters: Implemented getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes while maintaining data integrity.
Method Overloading: Demonstrated method overloading to handle different initialization scenarios effectively.
This project allowed me to apply object-oriented programming concepts, focusing on encapsulation, data protection, and method overloading.
